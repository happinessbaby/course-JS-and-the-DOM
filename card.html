			<p class="descrip">
			The other two pigments found in bird plummage are melanin and porphyrin.
			Unlike melanin and porphyrin, carotoneid can only be derived from plants, so cardinals
			have to eat a carotoneid-rich diet to maintain their red color. Interestingly,
		carotoneid can also be expressed in yellow and orange. So while these birds
	express their carotoneid in red, a gene mutation can turn them yellow.
